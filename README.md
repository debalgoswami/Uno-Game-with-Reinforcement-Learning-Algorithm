# Uno-Game-with-Reinforcement-Learning-Algorithm

This reporsitory creates an entire Uno game and implements three Reinforcement Learning Algoriths:
1. Monte Carlo Algorithm
2. SARSA
3. Q-Learning

It makes the three algorithm play each other in the Main.py code in order to check which performs the best in the long run in this game.
